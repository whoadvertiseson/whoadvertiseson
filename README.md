## WhoAdvertisesOn: A Conservative News Channel Advertiser Repository
WhoAdvertisesOn is an open data repository for collecting and sharing information on companies that are advertising on partisan news channels. Currently only data on Fox News Channel is included, but others may be added in the future.

### Purpose
For-profit television news is largely funded through advertising. To boost viewership, and thereby make ad slots more valuable, commercial news channels may set aside journalistic standards in favor of more sensational and emotional styles of programming. Furthermore, partisan channels such as those that claim to be “conservative” may additionally selectively report or distort information for political gain. These deviations from journalistic standards have real world consequences that effect lives and families of even non-viewers. Thus all citizens have a right to know whose dollars are funding these channels.

### Sampling Strategy
The most comprehensive way to know who is advertising on a particular channel would entail watching every hour every day, yet this is not feasible for volunteers. Therefore the notion of "sampling" is used to gather data with less effort. The strategy is that nearly every day a volunteer watches a channel for a fifteen minute interval at an arbitrary time (excluding overnight), and collects data about observed advertisements. Over time this should generate a comprehensive picture of advertising on a particular channel.

### Data Collection
Currently the following data is collected for each observed advertisement: 

*CompanyName, ProductName, DateObserved, TimeOfDay, Channel, ShowName*

### Data Files
Currently the following files are available in the repository: 

*FoxNewsChannel_ObservedAdvertisements.csv*

### Update Frequency
The goal is to collect a small amount of data daily and to update the dataset weekly.
