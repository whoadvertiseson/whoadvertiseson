# WhoAdvertisesOn
## An open data repository of advertisers whose ads appear on partisan news outlets, such as Fox News Channel.

### Project Purpose
For-profit television news is funded through advertising. To boost viewership and make ad spots more valuable, commercial news channels may set aside journalistic standards in favor of more sensational and emotional styles of programming. Furthermore, partisan channels, such as conservative media, may additionally selectively report or distort information for political gain. These deviations from journalistic standards have real world consequences that effect lives and families of even non-viewers. Therefore all citizens have a right to know whose dollars are funding these channels.

### Sampling Strategy
The most comprehensive way to know who is advertising on a particular channel would entail watching every hour every day, yet this is not feasible for volunteers. Therefore the notion of "sampling" is used to gather data with less effort. Our strategy is that nearly every day a volunteer watches a channel for a fifteen minute interval at an arbitrary time (excluding overnight), and collects data about observed advertisements. Over time this should generate a comprehensive picture of advertising on a particular channel.

### Data Collection
Currently the following data is collected for each observed advertisement: 

*CompanyName, ProductName, DateObserved, TimeOfDay, Channel, ShowName*

### Data Files
Currently data is only being collected about Fox News Channel, and the following files are available in the repository: 

- *[FoxNewsChannel_ObservedAdvertisements.csv](https://github.com/whoadvertiseson/whoadvertiseson/blob/main/FoxNewsChannel_ObservedAdvertisements.csv)*
