## WhoAdvertisesOn Conservative News Channels
WhoAdvertisesOn is an open data repository for collecting and sharing information on companies that are advertising on conservative news channels. Currently only data on Fox News Channel is included, but others may be added in the future.

### Purpose
For-profit television news is largely funded through advertising. To boost viewership, and thereby make their ad slots more valuable, commercial new channels may set aside journalistic standards in favor of more sensational and emotional styles of programming. Furthermore, partisan news channels such as those that claim to be “conservative” may additionally selectively report or distort information for political gain. These deviations from journalistic standards have real world consequences that effect the lives and families of even non-viewers of these channels. Thus all citizens have a right to know whose dollars are funding these channels.

### Sampling Strategy
The most comprehensive approach to knowing who is advertising on a particular conservative news channel would entail watching every hour every day, yet this approach is not feasible for a volunteer project. Therefore the research notion of "sampling" is applied to gather such data with less effort. The strategy we aim to employ is that: every day a volunteer watches watches Fox News for a fifteen minutes interval at an arbitrary time of day (excluding overnight hours), and collects data about any observed advertisements. Over time this should generate a comprehensive picture of who is advertising on a particular Channel as eventually more shows and times of day would be covered.

### Data Collection
The following data is currently collected for each observed advertisement: 

*CompanyName, ProductName, DateObserved, TimeOfDay, Channel, ShowName*

### Update Frequency
The goal is to collect a small of data daily and to update the dataset weekly.
